## Problem Statement
The agricultural sector grapples with inefficiencies in pest detection and management, impacting crop health and overall productivity. Our project aims to address these challenges by leveraging image processing techniques to automate and enhance pest detection, offering a solution for more effective crop management and ultimately elevating agricultural productivity.

## Dataset Decription
Dataset consists of 56,685 high-quality images sorted into 132 pest classes, along with relevant information on the pesticides used to control them.
*Dataset Source:*

## Plan of Action

## Our Goal:
Obtain clearly segmented and labelled parts of the image to correctly identify the pest in the image and recommend pesticide for the identified class of pest.


## Our Project:

### Project Name: *Pest Detection and Pesticide Recommendation System*

### Project Description:
Our project aims to enhance farming techniques for farmers by utilizing image analysis to detect pests on crops and reduce the use of pesticides. Pest detection and counting is typically a labour intensive and time-consuming task for farmers. By automating the process through image analysis, farmers can monitor the crops more efficiently, apply targeted pest management strategies, limit the usage of pesticides, and improve both crop quantity and quality.

### Technologies Used:
Python libraries such as 
- sciKit-image
- SimpleITK
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Pandas
- StreamLit

### Results: 
Our pest detection system was able to achieve an accuracy of 65.035% on the test data. This accuracy explains the pest detection ability of the model.

### Limitations and Future Work
- Feature engineering can be performed more accurately with additional characteristics and metadata for better pest detection.
- Future analysis and model building can be done using various other deep learning techniques and complex modelingÂ techniques.
