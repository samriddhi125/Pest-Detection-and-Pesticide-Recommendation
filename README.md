# Pest Detection and Pesticide Recommendation

## Introduction
Our project aims to enhance farming techniques for farmers by utilizing image analysis to detect pests on crops and reduce the use of pesticides. Pest detection and counting is typically a labour intensive and time-consuming task for farmers. By automating the process through image analysis, farmers can monitor the crops more efficiently, apply targeted pest management strategies, limit the usage of pesticides, and improve both crop quantity and quality.
