# Pest Detection and Pesticide Recommendation

## Introduction
Our project aims to enhance farming techniques for farmers by utilizing image analysis to detect pests on crops and reduce the use of pesticides. Pest detection and counting is typically a labour intensive and time-consuming task for farmers. By automating the process through image analysis, farmers can monitor the crops more efficiently, apply targeted pest management strategies, limit the usage of pesticides, and improve both crop quantity and quality.

## Meet the Team
We are a team of inquisitive undergraduate students pursuing B.Tech in AIML from Symbiosis Institute of Technology - Pune, India.

## Problem Statement
The agricultural sector grapples with inefficiencies in pest detection and management, impacting crop health and overall productivity. Our project aims to address these challenges by leveraging image processing techniques to automate and enhance pest detection, offering a solution for more effective crop management and ultimately elevating agricultural productivity.

## Plan of Action

## Our Goal:
Obtain clearly segmented and labelled parts of the image to correctly identify the pest in the image and recommend pesticide for the identified class of pest.
